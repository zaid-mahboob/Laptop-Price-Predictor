# Laptop-Price-Predictor
I have trained a machine learning model for Laptop Price Prediction. The model which I have used is Random Forest Regression. 

First we have to preprocess the data, in our case our first
we did all the preprocessing according to the factors which were impacting the 
price of the laptop.
After that we have simply applied random forest regression model on the
data. We have extracted the trained model in a pickle file.

Afterwards we have used streamlit to have a simple gui and deploy it
on our local host.
